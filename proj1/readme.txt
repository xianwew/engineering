1,When both Yellow and Blue buttons are pressed simultaneously, the script will enter the blink
mode and toggle all of the outputs (LEDs) in each iteration, at a rate controllable by Red and
Green buttons (Red and Green buttons control speed of blinking (slower and faster) for LEDs).
2,All of the outputs (LEDs) stop blinking (exit blink mode) when both Yellow and Blue buttons
are pressed simultaneously, or an activated timer reaches a specic threshold (example: 5s to 10s
delay).

Please refer to proj1 in my python-programming repository for code.
